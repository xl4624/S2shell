# S2shell

S2shell (a pun on S2 Cell and shell :crab:) is a Rust port of Google's [S2 Geometry Library](https://github.com/google/s2geometry), a package for manipulating geometric shapes. Unlike many geometry libraries, S2 is primarily designed to work with spherical geometry, i.e., shapes drawn on a sphere rather than on a planar 2D map. This makes it especially suitable for working with geographic data.

S2 documentation can be found on [s2geometry.io](http://s2geometry.io/).
